# Deep-Q Learning algorithm implementation using TensorFlow library

This project represents the implementation of the popular reinforcement learning algorithm called Deep-Q Learning introduced by Google Deep Mind. The reference to the paper is given on the following link:[Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf)
 
The implementation consists of:

1. Deep Q-Learning 
2. Using experience replay memory 
3. Using two separate deep convolutional neural networks: Q and Target-Q network
